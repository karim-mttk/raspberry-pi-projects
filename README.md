# raspberry-pi-projects
These are projects that I am currently working with during my leisure time. 
The goal is to use the GPIO pins of Raspberry Pi to operate components on bredboards and learn the details of ARM assembly language. 
The low-level code is written in ARM assembly, following the instructions of Pi's ARM procecssor: Broadcom BCM2711. The high-level Code is written in Python3 with the help of 'RPi.GPIO'library. 
Advance projects are on the way once I get the hang of it! ;)
