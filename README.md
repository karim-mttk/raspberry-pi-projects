# raspberry-pi-projects
These are projects that I am currently working with during my leisure time. 
The goal is to use the GPIO pins of Raspberry Pi to operate components on bredboards. 
Code is written in Python3 with the help of 'RPi.GPIO'library and raspberry pi 4b. 
Advance projects are on the way once I get the hang of it! ;)
